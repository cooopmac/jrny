Author: Cooper MacGregor

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for "OpenJourney," a mobile application designed to empower users to define, track, and achieve their personal and lifelong goals through an intelligent, AI-driven step-generation process. Unlike traditional to-do lists or manual goal trackers, OpenJourney's core value lies in its ability to take a user's stated ambition (e.g., "learn TypeScript," "run a marathon," "write a novel") and automatically break it down into a manageable, actionable series of steps. The app aims to simplify the planning phase of goal achievement, provide a clear path forward, and motivate users through consistent progress tracking.

## **2\. Goals**

- **For Users:**
  - To effortlessly define any personal or professional goal within the app.
  - To receive AI-generated, actionable steps tailored to their specific goals.
  - To easily track progress on individual steps and overall goal completion.
  - To feel motivated and supported throughout their journey towards achieving their ambitions.
  - To have a clear, organized overview of all their current and completed goals.
  - To reduce the overwhelm often associated with large or complex goals.
- **For the Platform (OpenJourney App):**
  - To provide a simple, intuitive, and engaging user interface for goal input and management.
  - To deliver high-quality, relevant, and actionable steps through its AI engine.
  - To ensure reliable progress tracking and data synchronization.
  - To build a foundation for future features like personalized insights, reminders, and community support.
  - To establish a freemium model for sustainable growth and development.

## **3\. Target Audience**

- Individuals seeking a structured and guided approach to achieving personal or professional goals.
- People who feel overwhelmed by large ambitions and need help breaking them down.
- Students, professionals, hobbyists, and anyone with a desire for self-improvement and lifelong learning.
- Users comfortable with mobile applications and AI-assisted tools.
- Individuals looking for a private, personal tool to manage their aspirations, rather than a public sharing platform.

## **4\. User Stories (MVP \- Minimum Viable Product)**

### **Core Goal Management & AI Interaction:**

- As a new user, I want to sign up easily using my email/password or a social login (e.g., Google, Apple).
- As a user, I want to be able to input a new goal with a clear title or description (e.g., "Learn to play the guitar").
- As a user, after inputting my goal, I want the app to use AI to generate a list of suggested steps to achieve it.
- As a user, I want to be able to review the AI-generated steps and mark them as complete.
- As a user, I want to see my overall progress towards a goal based on completed steps.
- As a user, I want to be able to manually add, edit, or delete steps if the AI suggestions are not perfect or if I have my own ideas.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark an entire goal as complete.
- As a user, I want to have a main dashboard where I can see all my active and completed goals.

### **Basic App Functionality:**

- As a user, I want to receive occasional, non-intrusive notifications or reminders about my active goals (e.g., "Don't forget to work on 'Learn TypeScript' today\!").
- As a user, I want to be able to access basic app settings, like managing my account or notification preferences.
- As a user, I want the app to have a clean, uncluttered, and visually appealing interface.

## **5\. Key Features (MVP Scope)**

- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure sign-up (Email/Password, Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In).
  - Login, password reset.
- **Goal Creation & AI Step Generation:**
  - Simple interface to input goal title/description.
  - Integration with a language model API (e.g., Gemini API) to process the goal and generate a structured list of actionable steps.
  - Display of AI-generated steps to the user.
- **Goal & Step Management:**
  - Dashboard view listing active and completed goals.
  - Detailed view for each goal, showing its steps.
  - Ability to mark steps as complete (e.g., checkboxes).
  - Visual progress indicator for each goal (e.g., progress bar, percentage).
  - Ability to manually add, edit, reorder, and delete steps.
  - Ability to mark a goal as complete or archive it.
- **Basic Notifications:**
  - Optional reminders for active goals (user-configurable frequency or smart suggestions later).
- **Settings:**
  - Account management (logout, delete account).
  - Notification preferences.
- **User Interface:**
  - Clean, intuitive, and mobile-first design.

## **6\. Non-Goals for MVP (Potential Future Features)**

- **Advanced AI Customization:** Fine-tuning AI step generation parameters by the user.
- **Sub-steps or Nested Goals:** Keeping the hierarchy simple for MVP (Goal \-\> Steps).
- **Calendar Integration or Deadline Setting:** Focus on step completion rather than strict scheduling initially.
- **Social Sharing / Community Features:** The app is primarily for personal use in MVP.
- **Gamification / Rewards:** Badges, points, streaks.
- **File Attachments or Rich Notes per Step:** Keep steps as simple text actions.
- **Third-party Integrations:** (e.g., fitness trackers, learning platforms).
- **Offline-first full functionality:** Basic caching is okay, but core AI features will require connectivity.
- **Web or Desktop Version.**
- **Advanced Analytics & Reporting.**

## **7\. Technical Considerations**

- **Mobile Development Platform:**
  - Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) for broader reach and faster development.
  - Native (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) for optimal performance if resources allow.
- **AI Integration:**
  - Backend service to securely call a text generation API (e.g., Gemini API via Google Cloud Functions or similar).
  - Prompt engineering to ensure AI provides relevant, actionable, and well-structured steps.
  - Handling API rate limits, errors, and response times.
- **Backend & Database:**
  - Cloud-based BaaS (Backend as a Service) like Firebase (Firestore for database, Authentication, Functions) or AWS Amplify.
  - Database schema to store user accounts, goals, steps, and progress.
- **API Design:** If a custom backend is built, well-defined APIs for communication between the app and backend.
- **Security:** Secure handling of user data and API keys.
- **Scalability:** Choose services that can scale with user growth.
- **App Store Submission:** Adherence to Apple App Store and Google Play Store guidelines.

## **8\. Monetization Strategy (Future)**

- **Freemium Model:**
  - **Free Tier:**
    - Limited number of active goals (e.g., 3-5).
    - Limited number of AI-generated step breakdowns per month.
    - Basic features.
  - **Premium Tier (Subscription):**
    - Unlimited active goals.
    - Unlimited AI-generated step breakdowns.
    - Access to advanced features as they are developed (e.g., more detailed progress insights, advanced notification options, goal templates).
    - Priority support.

## **9\. Success Metrics (Post-Launch)**

- **User Acquisition:**
  - Number of app downloads.
  - Number of registered users.
- **Engagement & Usage:**
  - Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU).
  - Average number of goals created per user.
  - Average number of steps generated/completed per goal.
  - Session length and frequency.
- **Goal Achievement:**
  - Goal completion rate.
  - User retention rate (short-term and long-term).
- **Monetization (Later):**
  - Conversion rate from free to premium.
  - Subscription churn rate.
- **App Performance & Stability:**
  - Crash rates.
  - Average API response time for AI step generation.
  - App store ratings and reviews.

## **10\. Risks & Challenges**

- **AI Step Quality & Relevance:** Ensuring the AI consistently provides useful, actionable, and safe steps. Requires robust prompt engineering and potentially user feedback mechanisms.
- **User Motivation & Adherence:** Keeping users engaged and actively working on their goals. The app itself cannot force completion.
- **Scope Creep:** Resisting the urge to add too many features to the MVP.
- **Technical Complexity of AI Integration:** Managing API calls, costs, and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Competition:** Differentiating from existing to-do list apps, project management tools, and simpler goal trackers. The AI step generation is the key differentiator.
- **Development Time & Resources:** Building a polished mobile app with AI integration can be time-consuming for a solo developer or small team.
- **User Onboarding:** Clearly communicating the app's value and how to use the AI feature effectively.
